<p>Nearly fifty years have passed since
Archibald M. Willard painted “The
Spirit of ’76.” Mr. Willard has passed,
and so have all who were intimately connected
with its creation, except myself.
Probably no painting, the creation of an
American artist, has received such wide
and continuous interest and attention as
this patriotic painting. Many times during
the last quarter of a century, I have
been urged to record my recollections of
Willard and my association with this historical
painting. Many times I have
been asked for information which did not
come under my personal observation. As
the years pass, this demand for information
has become more insistent and more
urgent. This little volume has been prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
partly to meet this demand, but
more especially to accede to the oft-repeated
requests of my family and friends.</p>

<p>These requests for information have
not always been confined to my own experiences.
Therefore, the more fully to
meet the wishes of my family and friends,
to my own personal recollections I have
added a brief sketch of the artist, of Hugh
Mosher the fifer, and Mr. Ryder’s own
account of the conception and purpose of
the artist, written many years ago and
now difficult to find. I have also added a
few words regarding the extant original
sketches and the Replica of 1912.</p>

<p>“The Spirit of ’76” is the best known
painting produced by an American, and
at the same time one of the most inspiring
works of art ever issued in America. It
may not conform to any orthodox school
of painting or possess the fine points of
technique that some critics demand, but
as an inspiration of patriotism, I doubt if
any painting has had as wide and continuous
influence as “The Spirit of ’76.” It
has been reproduced in one form and another
millions of times, by almost every
available process—chromo-lithography,
steel-engraving, half-tone, and the various
color processes. It is perhaps available
in more homes than any other American
painting, either framed or in magazines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
printed books, school histories, calendars,
posters, etc. Many a patriotic parade has
included the famous trio of this painting.</p>

<p>Although the painting is so universally
known, it is surprising that so little authentic
printed material is available
either on the artist himself or the story of
the creation of this, his most celebrated
work.</p>

<p>Archibald M. Willard, the painter of
“The Spirit of ’76” was born in Bedford,
Ohio, August 22, 1836. His father, the
Reverend Samuel Willard, was a Baptist
minister and a Vermonter. In the home
was grandfather Willard, between whom
and the young artist there grew to be a
strong bond of understanding and sympathy.
The grandfather, a relative of
General Stark and a soldier of the Revolutionary
War, was one of the Green
Mountain boys who was at the surrender
of General Burgoyne. Grandfather and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
grandson spent much time together in
rambles through the then picturesque
Bedford glens. The rugged surroundings
appealed to young Willard’s artistic
sense. The old man figured often in the
boy’s cartoons. Many a tree was stripped
of its outer bark to produce a smooth
surface upon which with red chalk and
charred embers the young artist produced
savages of hideous mien. As frequently
happens with young artists, young Willard,
did not receive much encouragement
from the Willard family, perhaps because
every smooth surface of wall, barn-door,
board fence, etc., bore evidence to
the budding genius.</p>

<p>For varying periods, the family were
located at Kent, Salem, Aurora, Mantua,
and La Grange. When Willard was a
lad of seventeen, the family moved to
Wellington, Lorain county, Ohio. At the
outbreak of the Civil War, Willard enlisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
in the Eighty-sixth Ohio Regiment.
While with his regiment at Cumberland
Gap, he painted several pictures of the
surrounding country. These were photographed
and many of the photographs
were sold to his comrades.</p>

<p>With the close of the Civil War, Archibald
M. Willard, then a sturdy young
man, returned to Wellington, together
with his close companion, Hugh Mosher.
Both had served faithfully and well.
Willard had become a non-commissioned
officer. He secured employment in the
shop of E. S. Tripp, a wheelwright and
wagon-maker. The old shop still stands
at Wellington. Willard’s original job
was to paint the wagons. From the mere
painting of the wagons he gradually
passed to decorating the wagons artistically,
and finally to decorating, with woodland
and animal scenes, a number of
gaudy circus chariots. He did this work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
so artistically that “Tripp’s wagons” became
known all over that part of the
country. There was coöperation between
the two men, for apart from the artistic
painting, the wagons themselves were
sturdily and well-built. Willard’s artistic
temperament carried him beyond mere
commercial painting. He began painting
pictures on the wagon boxes. These
were so well executed that they created
much comment. He gradually became so
elaborate in these, that his employer, Mr.
Tripp, had to restrain him. Undoubtedly
the interest created by these paintings sold
many a wagon for their builder and advertised
him in a most unusual way. If
any of these Willard-decorated-Tripp-wagons
were now available, they would
bring a price far in excess of the cost of
the wagons themselves.</p>

<p>While working at his trade as wagon
painter, Willard devoted all his spare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
time, energy, and what little money he
could save to the study of painting on
canvas. He had a very decided sense of
humor and nearly all of his earlier subjects
are of a humorous character. It was
early in the seventies that he painted the
first two pictures from which he received
compensation. These were the outcome
of a request by his employer’s daughter
asking him to paint a picture for her.
“Pluck number One” was the result. It
depicts a dog hitched to a little wagon, a
boy driving, and his baby sister in the
wagon with him. The dog takes off the
road in chase of a rabbit, and the little
boy desperately trying to stop him. A
wreck follows where the rabbit jumps a
log, but the youthful occupant clinging
to the lines, and the little sister, escapes
unhurt.</p>

<p>In Cleveland at this time was a photographer
and art dealer named J. F.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Ryder. This painting came to his attention
with other early productions by Willard.
The astute Ryder quickly recognized
the quaint humor and natural
ability displayed in these early pictures.
Willard thereupon painted a sequel to
“Pluck” which he entitled “Pluck number
Two.” Mr. Ryder had these two
paintings reproduced in color by chromo-lithography.
They became two of the
most popular pictures of their day. They
sold at ten dollars the pair. Many thousands
were sold. This proved to be the
beginning of a long and profitable business
acquaintance and lasting friendship
between Willard and Ryder. The proceeds
from the sale of these pictures permitted
Willard to take an art course in
the studio of J. D. Eaton, of New York.
This was in 1873.</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Yankee Doodle</span>”</p>

<p class="center">Willard’s original conception for the humorous painting
submitted to J. F. Ryder. From this, the “Spirit of ’76,”
with its far-reaching inspiration, was finally evolved</p></div>
</div>

<p>Following this, Willard painted among
other things a picture which he called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
“Yankee Doodle.” It was an ordinary
sized canvas and delineated a Fourth of
July celebration in a country village. An
old man in the center beating a drum,
with a younger man on each side, the one
with a drum, the other with a fife. The
surroundings and background were rural.
This painting was finished a few months
prior to the opening of the Centennial Exposition
of 1876 at Philadelphia. When
Mr. Ryder saw the picture, he immediately
conceived the idea of changing the
subject from humorous to patriotic, and
Willard concurred in the idea.</p>

<p>Contrary to a rather general belief,
“The Spirit of ’76” was not painted for
exhibition at the Centennial. At that
period there was a general and widespread
spirit of patriotism and the days
of the Revolutionary War were especially
before the people of this country. Mr.
Ryder had this prominently in mind and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
for this reason he suggested to Willard
the painting of this picture that reproductions
therefrom might be made and a
large number of these reproductions
sold generally throughout the country
and particularly at the Centennial. It
was not sent to the Centennial until many
of these colored reproductions had been
distributed, and a large popular interest
in the painting had arisen. It was then,
on special request made by those in charge
of the Centennial that the original painting
itself was sent to the Exposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder suggested that the title be
“Yankee Doodle” and under this title
“The Spirit of ’76” was at first known.
He left the conception and development
of the painting to Willard’s imagination.</p>

<p>At that early period after the Civil
War, when the training days of the
militia system had practically gone to
pieces, the various companies were expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to go into camp for three days
each year. These days had become a
neighborhood picnic. Uniforms were
seldom in evidence. There were few
guns or swords. There were, however,
always the flag, the fife, and the drum.
Willard had this idea prominently before
him. He slashed into outline various
charcoal attempts, but the lines would not
fall or respond as he wanted them to. The
real idea as to what Yankee Doodle and
the men who fifed it and drummed it,
stood for, eventually began to thrust itself
persistently into the pencil points. Willard
daily became more enthused over the
patriotic features to be delineated. His
early days of marching and fighting under
the stars and stripes helped greatly in
stirring his patriotic enthusiasm, which
later was put upon and filled the completed
canvas.</p>

<p>While Willard was engaged in painting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
this picture, his father, who was posing
as his central figure, became critically
ill. He did not live to see the finished
painting. When Willard was told that
his father was soon to pass away, all
thoughts of a humorous picture faded
from his mind. He decided to paint his
father as he really was.</p>

<p>After Willard became acquainted with
Mr. Ryder, at Ryder’s suggestion, Willard
moved to Cleveland. He used as a
studio, a small room on the fourth floor
of what used to be the Union National
Bank Building located at Euclid Avenue
and what was then Hickox Alley, Cleveland,
Ohio. From this time on Willard
spent almost his entire life in Cleveland.</p>

<p>This little studio had a northern exposure,
and he was artist enough, even
then, to realize the value of the northern
light. His canvas when stretched was
taller than himself. His idea had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
a big one and nothing but life-size would
do for the figures to be used. He followed
the general idea of his first picture,
“Yankee Doodle or a Fourth of July Celebration”
but the spirit of the whole was
changed. The old man in the center was
Willard’s own father, a tall, straight,
powerful man, with flowing white locks
yet the figure of a man of thirty, without
coat, bare-headed, his white hair blowing
in the breeze, his shirt sleeves loose,
marching forward with a step as firm and
unhesitating as the grim and determined
look on his face. The face of the old man
shows features which could be kind, but
now set like flint in the face of the enemy—filled
with the courage of a man who has
put character, and thought, and prayer
into the music through which he utters
his patriotic purpose. Perhaps there is a
bit of humor in the figure of the fifer—it
could not be otherwise—for it is a portrait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
of the fifer of Wellington, Hugh
Mosher. While depicting his humorous
face with its puckered mouth, there is the
same air of determination in the figure,
the eyes, and the forward step, that so
mark the picture of the old man. In these
characters one sees the spirit of men who
will stand and play until they die, or by
their contagious heroism will turn the
tide of battle.</p>

<p>As already stated, for the first few
years the painting was known under the
title of “Yankee Doodle.” While the picture
was on exhibition in Boston, Mr.
Brainerd, who had charge of the exhibition,
suggested changing the title to
“Yankee Doodle, or the Spirit of ’76.”
This suggestion was made because at that
time in Boston there was a public character,
a half-wit, who was commonly
known about the city as “Yankee Doodle.”
In some curious way, the painting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
and this half-wit were being confused in
the public mind. This change of title
was adopted. Finally “Yankee Doodle”
was dropped entirely and the painting
has since been known under the title of
“The Spirit of ’76.”</p>

</div>


<p>When Archibald M. Willard returned
home from service in the Civil War, there
came back with him to Wellington his
comrade, Hugh Mosher. Mr. Willard
first became acquainted with Mosher after
the family moved to Wellington.
They soon became close and lifelong
friends. Their service in the Civil War,
in which they were comrades, more
closely cemented this friendship.</p>

<p>Hugh Mosher was born at Perry, Lake
county, Ohio, January twenty-ninth, 1819,
and died at Brighton, Ohio, August fifteenth,
1892. His father served in the
War of 1812, and his grandfather had
served in the Revolutionary War. He
himself enlisted for the Civil War, and
became a fifer in Company H, Forty-third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Infantry Regiment, Ohio Volunteers.
He never fully recovered from the
effects of his army hardships.</p>

<p>He was a tall and well built man, over
six feet in height. In appearance he suggested
a typical frontiersman of the Daniel
Boone or Simon Girty type.</p>

<p>Hugh Mosher (or Mosier as it is sometimes
wrongly spelled) who posed as the
fifer, spent most of his life in Wellington,
Ohio. Returning from the Civil War, he
again took up his farmwork. He was a
celebrated performer on the fife, and his
fame had spread throughout the surrounding
country. He was probably the
best fifer in northern Ohio. It is said of
him that he would rather fife than eat.
He carried this little instrument with him
wherever he went and delighted to play
whenever chance offered. No patriotic
gathering in or near Wellington was considered
complete without Mosher and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
fife. He was intensely patriotic, and even
in his last illness deeply regretted being
unable to attend the celebration of the
Fourth of July in his home town of Wellington.</p>

<p>He spent considerable time posing for
Mr. Willard, and many photographs of
him were taken by Mr. William F. Sawtelle,
a photographer of Wellington, for
use in Willard’s painting. Willard, however,
could not get satisfactory photographs
of Hugh Mosher. This was before
the day of the quick-acting shutter.
The cap of the camera could not be operated
quickly enough to get satisfactory
expression. For this reason, poor Hugh
Mosher had to go to Willard’s studio and
pose. In order to get the proper expression,
Mosher not only had to pose, but
had to continue fifing all the time he was
posing. Willard had a habit of calling
attention to the peculiar way in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Mosher held his fife—with the thumb
out.</p>

<p>The rumor is that after Willard had
made his many and individual studies of
Mosher, that Mosher was unable to get
to Cleveland to see the finished canvas of
“The Spirit of ’76.” He did not see it
until he visited the Centennial.</p>

<p>At the Centennial there was always a
crowd around the painting. Mosher
joined the crowd. While he thus stood
before the picture, someone in the crowd
recognized him, and he was immediately
given an ovation.</p>

<p>One of the original sketches for the
fifer, I believe, still exists. It was in existence
and exhibited in Cleveland, November,
1912. At the same time also was
exhibited a marble figure of the old
drummer, Willard’s father.</p>

<p>In the original sketches for “Yankee
Doodle,” Willard depicted three grown
men. When the humorous aspect faded
from his conception, and he decided to
depict his father seriously, he conceived
the idea of including for his third figure
a young lad instead of a grown man. In
this way, the picture would present three
generations of patriots, the grandfather
in the center, the father at his side, and on
his right, the grandson looking up into
grandpa’s face with confidence and admiration.</p>

<p>In 1875, there was organized in Cleveland,
Brooks School, a preparatory school
for boys from ten years upward. It was
so named after its inceptor, the Reverend
John Brooks, who lost his life in a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
tragic manner while in Boston to secure a
principal for the school. It was a military
school. In 1876, it was domiciled in
its building on Carnegie Avenue (then
Sibley Street) near the present East Thirty-sixth
street. The spirit of the boys in
the school was very military. They had
for instructor the late Captain F. A. Kendall,
who served with distinction during
the Civil War. Three companies composed
the Brooks School Battalion. The
first company composed of the older boys;
the second, of the intermediate; and the
third, of the smaller boys in both age and
stature. For some reason the third company,
in competitive drills, always won
over the other two. This was due undoubtedly
to the natural sympathy older
people always have for the younger and
smaller when in competition. I was captain
of the Third Company and it was my
observation that the little fellows usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
got most of any sympathy being given,
yet, too, it was a noticeable fact that they
tried harder, paid closer attention, and
usually drilled more perfectly than the
older boys. On the sixth of March, 1876,
the Brooks School Battalion gave a competitive
drill at their armory, in compliment
to the Cleveland Grays, and as may
be guessed every boy was on his toes to
show the hero soldiers in gray what could
be done. Mr. Willard, desiring a subject
to use in his picture as a drummer boy,
attended this drill. Why he selected me
never has been explained to me. Maybe
an incident in the drill of the Third Company
had its effect. Anyway, to this day,
although nearly fifty years have passed,
recalling the happenings of that day
brings to me a thrill for the earnest effort
and perfection of drill of those little fellows.
The two companies of larger boys
had passed through their drill in a way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
please everybody. When it came time for
the little fellows to march out, every boy
was keyed to the limit. They went
through the set maneuvers perfectly and
when about finished, it popped into my
head to try something very difficult that
the others had not tried. Marching down
the side of the hall in column of fours,
and wheeling to the left, at the end I gave
the order “fours left into line and forward
guide right double-quick march.”
So perfect was the spacing between the
fours that they wheeled into line in perfect
alignment, broke into double quick
as one, and went charging down the hall
toward the spectators amid a burst of applause.
That settled the day and the
Third Company retained the honor of
being the color company.</p>

<p>One thing that likely intensified this
military spirit among us was the fact that
just at this time there was on exhibition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
at Cleveland, a panorama of the Battle of
Lookout Mountain. It was a splendid
picture, aroused much enthusiasm, and
the proceeds—in part at least—went to
pay for the completion of the soldier’s
monument at Dayton. A select squad
from the Brooks School Battalion gave
an exhibition drill in front of the picture
to help the entertainment.</p>

<p>Shortly after this competitive drill, my
father told me he had given permission to
Mr. Willard to use me as a model for the
drummer boy in his picture. I recall a
feeling of resentment on my part for that
meant giving up afternoon play, a thing
not to be contemplated with a feeling of
joy by any boy. However, paternal edicts
generally prevail, and a beginning was
made by going down to Mr. Ryder’s gallery
and posing for a number of photos.
This was followed by a number of visits
to Willard’s studio where hours were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
passed in rather a trying way for a boy.
Willard was very kind and thoughtful.
He entertained me with stories of the war,
told me what was in his mind for the creation
of this picture, and often would let
me rest and walk in front of the picture
to see what he had done. I can recall the
enthusiasm of the man. He worked as if
possessed of an idea that pleased him, but
which he might lose. With watching
him work and the picture develop, I too
soon became enthusiastic. I forgot that it
was tiresome to stand on one leg, and that
bent, the other advanced, and the foot
resting on an inverted box, with the head
twisted to one side and the eyes raised
and arms outstretched, although it was
really very exacting of one’s temper and
strength. However, things progressed
rapidly, and by the thirtieth of March the
picture was about finished, and I took my
mother, at Willard’s request to see it. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
am sure she experienced the feeling that
thousands of our mothers have when they
have seen their beloved son marching off
to war. And then the momentous day
came when it was rolled up and sent to
the Centennial.</p>

<p>That fall I went to the Centennial with
my parents. We spent about two weeks
there. Almost every day I went into the
Art Gallery to stand before “The Spirit
of ’76.” Each time I felt something
aroused in me that did not diminish by
the frequent visits. It also was curious
to mark the effect on others. Always
there was a crowd in front of the picture
and many if not most of the people had
perceptible tears rise to their eyes as they
stood and gazed. Many actually cried,
yet came again and again to look with
reverence on that canvas that pulsed so
much of American spirit.</p>

<p>Later in life I stood before the picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
again, where it now hangs in Abbot Hall,
Marblehead, Mass., for which town my
father, Colonel John Henry Devereux,
bought the picture and presented it thereto.
Then, as before, not only to me but to
all in the room, arose a feeling of sentiment,
a feeling of reverence, a feeling
almost of awe that made one instinctively
bare one’s head and swallow the lump
that will sometimes come in one’s throat.</p>

<p>It may be that enthusiasm borne of an
intimate knowledge of the creation of this
picture makes me over-enthusiastic, but
then and afterwards, even to this day,
when I learn how it holds the interest of
all that look at it, the belief is strengthened
that the picture was an inspiration,
though it might be judged crude in execution
by artistic standards. I know little
or nothing of art, nor does the ordinary
individual looking at a picture, but any
one picture that can so universally move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the onlooker must convey something
deeper than the pigments on the canvas.
The determination and fight depicted by
the old man in face and figure, without
uniform, in shirt sleeves, coat off, sleeves
loose, vest open and shirt open at throat
without collar or stock is symbolical of
the patriot ready to fight without purchase
or thought of anything but the
cause at heart. The fifer, a touch of humor
for his, a humorous face, his fringe
of whiskers, but a bandage about his head
on which blood shows, a twinkle in his
eye, but a set look on the face and a decided
poise in the figure marching to his
own fife music. The boy fresh from a
loving mother’s care and carefully uniformed,
his eyes fixed upon his adored
grandsire that he may do all that this
loved, brave, and loyal man is determined
to do. The wounded soldier in the foreground,
his head pillowed on the shell-shattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
wheel of a cannon, with heart
and strength enough left to raise his cap
in salute to “Old Glory.” Over them
all the flag of freedom, the stars and
stripes, back of which come the first line
of cheering patriotic troops entering action.
It tells the story of the old way,
and of the spirit and determination when
men fought face to face, each individual
a fighting machine to fight for love of
country and freedom.</p>

<p>The flag is really an anachronism, as
although it depicts the thirteen stripes
and the thirteen stars on a blue field, it
was not until June, 1777, that the United
State Congress really accepted this design,
and Betsy Ross made the first flag
with these emblems.</p>

<p>The painting created little or no stir
among the art critics and connoisseurs.
It was not painted for such. The painting
was a patriotic human document that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
reached the hearts of millions and will
for centuries to come be an inspiration to
further millions yet unborn.</p>

<p>Archibald M. Willard has passed. He
may not be classed as a great artist but in
the “Spirit of ’76” he painted himself into
everlasting fame.</p>

</div>


<p>The conception and purpose of the
artist and his adviser cannot be better interpreted
than in Mr. Ryder’s own words,
written many years ago.</p>

<p>“The idea of the artist in painting the
picture was to concentrate all the determination
and enthusiasm possible in a
few figures. No field afforded a better
subject than the Revolution, with its determined
old heroes and the air of ‘Yankee
Doodle’ to rouse them to the highest
pitch of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“The three chief figures meet all the
requirements of the situation and are in
true keeping with the surroundings. Over
them lower the clouds of smoke from a
battle-field toward which they are marching.
Behind them a few brave Continentals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
struggle up the hill, while by the side
of a dismantled cannon lies a wounded
soldier who raised himself on his elbow
to give a last cheer to the stirring strains
of ‘Yankee Doodle.’ The lines have
evidently been forced back. The dying
soldier and the broken cannon show
where the line has stood. The other soldiers
have been retreating. But the three
musicians advance, and the sound of their
music thrills the retreating troops with
new courage. Hats are in the air; the
flag has turned; the threatened defeat is
about to become a victory. The dying
man raised himself to cheer. The trio of
homespun musicians are discoursing with
all their might that music whose shrill
melody is so surcharged with patriotism.
The old drummer in the centre, bare-headed,
grand in his fearlessness, without
coat, one sleeve rolled up as though he
had turned from the plough to grasp the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
drumsticks, his white hair blown in the
air, his eyes set close and defiant as though
he saw the danger and feared it not, the
sharp lines about his mouth showing a
fixed determination—all combine to
make up that wonderful figure in our history
which no rags could degrade nor
splendor ennoble—the Continental soldier.</p>

<p>“On the left of the brave old drummer
is the fifer who seems to have come to
blow his fife, and he will do it as well
here among the flying bullets as in the
porch of his cottage. His eyes are fixed
toward the sky as though reading the
notes of his music on the clouds. Around
his brow is a blood-stained handkerchief,
which tells of the bullet which grazed yet
spared him. His whole energy is poured
into the reed at his lips, and one can almost
hear the shrill notes of ‘Yankee
Doodle’ above the noise of battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“On the right of the old man marches
a boy, hardly in his teens, whose drum
keeps time to the beat of the other. His
face is upturned to the old man, as though
he were his grandfather, as if to question
perhaps the route or the danger ahead,
but still with a look of rapt inspiration.
No shade of fear lurks in his calm eyes,
while the ‘rub-a-dub’ of his little drum
sounds as clear and distinct as the heavier
roll of the aged drummer.</p>

<p>“The entire group is conceived with a
fervid sympathy which makes the observer
concede sure victory to the combatants;
victory also to the artist. The man
who had carried the stars and stripes,
marching under the same thrilling tune,
put his heart into the picture. The work
was an inspiration. Mr. Willard had no
thought of depicting three generations of
one family, but the inference is so natural
that he has cheerfully adopted it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“The canvas is large and figures are
heroic in size. When finished, the picture
was placed in the show window of
my art store in Cleveland. The crowds
which gathered about it blockaded the entrance
to the gallery and obstructed the
sidewalk to such an extent that it was
necessary to remove it from the window
to the rear of the store, where it was on
exhibition for several days, during which
time all business in the store was discontinued
on account of the crowds which
filled the place. The interest and enthusiasm
which it created were remarkable.
The late Right Reverend Bishop Bedell
was a daily visitor and frequently spent
an entire half day, so deeply was he impressed.</p>

<p>“The painting was finally sent to the
Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia
and prominently placed in Memorial
Hall, where it created a notable interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
throughout the Exposition. After which
by earnest request it was taken to Boston
and exhibited for several weeks in the
Old South Meetinghouse. Thence it was
taken to the Corcoran Gallery at Washington,
thence to Chicago, San Francisco,
and other cities, always by request—so
great was the desire of the public to see
the painting which had aroused such enthusiasm
in the hearts of a patriotic people.
At last it found a permanent home
in Abbot Hall at Marblehead, Mass., the
gift to that old town of the late General
J. H. Devereux, who purchased it from
Willard to present it to the town of his
birth. It stands in the old hall which
breathes of historic patriotism. It is the
pride of the people of Marblehead and of
all Americans who visit it.</p>

<p>“Pictures have been painted by artists
of great skill, possessing qualities of technique
of method, valuable beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
works of other artists; pictures which
give pleasure to experts and connoisseurs.
In the midst of such works ‘The Spirit of
’76’ stands. The eye wanders from these
works of great technique, and is awed by
the grandeur of the old man, by the force
of the fervid and devoted group, by the
spirit which invades the whole. Mr.
Willard with his powerful but, perhaps,
less finished touch did more than please
the eye of experts; he stirred the heart of
a nation.”</p>

</div>


<p>A number of preliminary sketches
were made. Of these, I believe, only one
is now in existence. It is owned by the
Reverend William E. Barton of Oak
Park, Illinois, who was formerly pastor
of the First Congregational Church at
Wellington, Ohio. It came into Doctor
Barton’s possession in the following manner.
In the preparation of his early
sketches for the preliminary groupings,
Mr. Willard was assisted by Mr. William
F. Sawtelle, a photographer of Wellington.
Willard gave this original
crayon sketch to Mr. Sawtelle. Mr. Sawtelle
preserved it, expecting to pass it on
to his son. His son died. Mr. Sawtelle
was a member of Doctor Barton’s church.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Upon the death of his son, Mr. Sawtelle
gave this crayon sketch to Doctor Barton.
This original rough sketch embodies
essentially the ideas wrought out in
the oil painting, but naturally it is rough
and unfinished. The drummer boy is a
head shorter. His face is in the shadow.
The dying man is much too prominent in
the foreground, a mistake which Willard
later corrected. Apart from these points,
it lacks altogether the spirit and inspiration
which Willard worked into his finished
painting.</p>

<p>Apart from the preliminary sketch referred
to in the preceding paragraph,
Doctor Barton possesses an original
painting of “The Spirit of ’76” made by
Mr. Willard. This Willard executed in
oils and in size thirty-four by twenty-eight
inches. This painting was made in
1916 and really constitutes the third and
last original painting of “The Spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
’76” made by Mr. Willard. The original
and the Cleveland replica are full size.
This third painting is really executed in
miniature. Willard did not attempt to
make an exact copy; hence, in this small
painting there are many variations from
the two larger paintings. It was presented
to Doctor Barton. It was painted
by Mr. Willard to replace a large photograph
of “The Spirit of ’76” which was
hanging in Doctor Barton’s home during
one of Mr. Willard’s visits. Doctor Barton’s
home then being in Oak Park, Illinois.
The Reverend William E. Barton
was for many years a close personal friend
of Mr. Willard, and conducted his funeral
services. Mr. Willard died at 4933
Holyoke Avenue, Cleveland, October 11,
1918. The funeral services were held in
Cleveland, but the burial was in the
Willard lot, among his old friends at
Wellington, Ohio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Doctor Barton also possesses probably
the only original sketch made to convey
Willard’s original conception of what he
intended to call “Yankee Doodle,” the
idea of which was entirely changed after
he met and talked with Ryder, and a patriotic
instead of a humorous conception
was decided on. Doctor Barton had
asked Willard if he had any of his first
sketches that were humorous, to which
Willard had replied that he had not
preserved any of these. Doctor Barton
then asked him whether he had the original
idea of the Fourth of July celebration
which he had intended to call “Yankee
Doodle” sufficiently in mind to make for
Doctor Barton a sketch which would embody
Willard’s original conception for
the painting. Willard replied that he
had this original idea well in mind and
would be glad to make for Doctor Barton
a crayon sketch thereof. A little later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Willard made this and in sending this to
Doctor Barton, with characteristic humor
entitled it “The First Sketch that was
made Last.” This sketch does not typify
“The Spirit of ’76.” It is merely the
forerunner out of which “The Spirit of
’76” was evolved. It is strictly a humorous
sketch of Fourth of July musicians
marching. The wonderful inspiration
developed in “The Spirit of ’76” is entirely
lacking. This Willard made for
Doctor Barton in 1898.</p>

<p>In 1912 a replica of “The Spirit of
’76” was made by Willard himself. Willard
was then 76 years of age. This replica
was executed for the City of Cleveland
as a special Commission. This is
located in a prominent place in the new
City Hall at Cleveland. It is fitting that
this replica should be available in Cleveland
where “The Spirit of ’76” was conceived
and executed by a Cleveland artist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
and painted from Cleveland and northern
Ohio subjects. This replica naturally is
not as well executed as the original. This
would be almost impossible at Willard’s
then advanced age. In this replica Willard
incorporated a number of changes.
The coloring is different. He changed
the arrangement of the stars from a circle
of thirteen stars to a circle of nine with
four stars in the center. He moderated
the stride of the men. He changed the
wounded soldier in the foreground to a
more upright position. He changed the
drummer boy. The drummer boy who
posed in the Cleveland replica was Willard’s
grandson, Williard Connelly, a
Cleveland Central High School boy.</p>

<p>In 1917, another artist, James M.
Flagg, painted a picture which he entitled
“The Spirit of 1917” for which he

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
